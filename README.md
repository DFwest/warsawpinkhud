# About

WarsawHUD is a Team Fortress 2 HUD with a focus on those with high resolution (1440p or greater) displays, and with an additional focus on visibility. Long gone are the plagues of other HUDs with giant text that blocks large areas of your screen, or the monotony of the same general material style that everyone has been copying off of for almost four years now, or those fugly rounded corners that break harmony between different elements.
